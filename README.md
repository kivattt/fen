`V` Start selecting by moving\
`n` Create a new file\
`N` Create a new folder\
`?` Toggle file properties window

# Configuration
Linux/FreeBSD: `~/.config/fen/fenrc.json` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fen/fenrc.json` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set\
macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/fen/fenrc.json`\
Windows: `%AppData%\Roaming\fen\fenrc.json`

You can find a complete example config in the [fenrc.json](fenrc.json) file\
You can specify a different config file path with the `--config` flag

The `"open-with"` file matching starts from the top, so you can have something like this at the end of the list to catch anything not previously matched:
```json
{
    "programs": ["vim -p"],
    "match": ["*"]
}
```

You can use "do-not-match" in conjunction with "match":
```json
{
    "programs": ["notepad"],
    "match": ["*"],
    "do-not-match": ["*.exe"]
}
```
Programs in `"programs"` do not expand tildes like `"~/some/file.sh"`. You have to specify an absolute path.\
If you want to use a shell script in `"programs"`, it has to have a shebang or you need to explicitly invoke the appropriate shell like `"bash /some/file.sh"`\
Note: Programs will be started in the working directory you're inside in fen

# File previews
fen does not (yet!) have file previews by default\
For file previews with programs like `cat` or `head`, you can add something like this to your fenrc.json:
```json
"preview-with": [
    {
        "programs": ["head -n 100"],
        "match": ["*"]
    }
]
```

For something cross-platform, file previews can also be a [lua script](lua-file-preview-examples/basic.lua). You can use them by setting "script" in "preview-with":
```json
"preview-with": [
    {
        "script": "basic.lua",
        "match": ["*"]
    }
]
```
If "script" is set, "programs" will be ignored in the same "preview-with" entry.\
"script" is not a list like "programs" is, because we want to see syntax errors when writing lua code instead of falling back to anything.\
The "script" key can either be an absolute path e.g. `"/home/user/my-script.lua"` or a relative path: `"my-script.lua"` which will correspond to `~/.config/fen/my-script.lua` (or the respective OS config path, see: [Configuration](#Configuration))

# Writing file preview scripts with Lua
Do not use `print()`, it outputs to stdout which doesn't work well within fen.\
You can find examples in [lua-file-preview-examples](lua-file-preview-examples)

### Available functions:
`fen:Print(text, x, y, maxWidth, alignment, color)` Print text at the given x/y position. x=0, y=0 is the top left corner of the file preview area and limited to the file preview area only [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#Print)\
`fen:PrintSimple(text, x, y)` Same as above, with default color and alignment and no maxWidth [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#PrintSimple)\
`fen:Escape(text)` Escape style tags [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#Escape)\
`fen:TranslateANSI(text)` Turn ANSI into style tags [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#TranslateANSI)\
`fen:NewRGBColor(r, g, b)` [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2#NewRGBColor)\
`fen:ColorToString(color)` [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2#Color.String)\
`fen:RuntimeOS()` The OS fen is running in [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#pkg-constants)

Notes about `fen:Print()` and `fen:PrintSimple()`:\
Newlines will not show up, and do nothing. You will have to manually call it multiple times, increasing y.\
Tabs are replaced with 4 spaces so they are visible

### Available variables:
`fen.SelectedFile` Currently selected file absolute file path to preview\
`fen.Width` Width of the file preview area\
`fen.Height` Height of the file preview area

# Known issues
- Deleting files sometimes doesn't work on Windows
- Setting a boolean command-line flag to false, e.g. `--no-write=false` has no effect, and the configuration file value will be prioritized. You can disable loading the config file by giving a bogus filename: `--config=aaaaa`
- `go test` doesn't work on Windows
- The color for audio files is invisible in the default Windows Powershell colors, but not cmd or Windows Terminal

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for other issues and possible future features, roughly sorted by priority
