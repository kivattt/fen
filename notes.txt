- Fixed a bug where toggling `fen.hidden_files` in the options menu would not invalidate the folder file count cache
- Fixed a bug where fen would crash after a while when left in an unmounted/deleted directory
- Added `fen.file_size_in_all_panes` option to show file sizes in all panes, not just the middle
- `Ctrl+Right` in Git repositories now correctly goes to the first changed non-folder closest to the root of the repository, instead of just selecting the shortest filepath

- transferring between HostFileSystem and SFTPFileSystem
- check that file := theFS.Open(...) is actually closeable etc
- show sftp server username in the top-left
- add a menu to the left of root to login to sftp server (filezilla integration on user accept)
- dynamic fs selection list (for MTP, to detect camera plugged in or not)

- DONE (history per fs): on filesystem change, reset history (or keep specific one per fs)
- DONE: disabled `!` for sftp
- DONE: removed cmd.Dir = fen.wd for bulkrename
- DONE: Disable file watching for SFTPFileSystem
- DONE (we just createtemp on host): os.CreateTemp might not work out on SFTPFileSystem (maybe disable bulk-rename on SFTPFileSystem)
- DONE (disallow opening files on non-host): file previews and opening files need to download them first...
- DONE: prevent path separator bugs by not using os.PathSeparator, instead it is determined by theFS current file system

Filesystem ideas:
- FTP
- TFTP
- Shell over UART/other serial (ls parsing)
