## TODOs, vaguely sorted by priority

- Bulk rename
- Scrollable search history
- Better scrolling
- File operations async queue (with undo when applicable)
- Make file previews async
- Show ~/ in top bar for /home/$USER
- Show user@something in top bar
- Changing owner/group, chmod inside fen
- Index/Length (maybe even percentage) in the bottom right like in vim/ranger
- Refactor bar.go into top bar and bottom bar
- Make draw functions for top bar / bottom bar scriptable with lua
- Global selection (selection stored in a file under UserCacheDir ?)
- cd Change directory
- A sort of "pause" (cross-platform please) after opening a file, configurable, maybe excluding it for certain programs like vim
- Shortcuts / bookmarks (think the 1,2,3,4 number row idea (maybe Ctrl+\<Number\> for it?)
- Ctrl+Shift+n, Ctrl+Shift+n search by content, search by path name like telescope
- Check if [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon) works, maybe just make my own built into fen with some gtk wrapper? (bad idea lol)
- Show current folder size beside disk size?
- A sort of --no-unicode option, to print the character codes instead of fancy unicode characters

- System-wide configuration file instructions
- Make file previews not run every time the terminal is resized?
- Installation instructions for Windows in the README
- Allow spaces in "programs" path in config with `\ `? (Maybe not, this might be annoying on Windows), maybe add os package ExpandEnv to allow using environment variables in "programs"
- .deb file in Releases
- Fix selecting text with mouse when noMouse = false
- Allow opening images with 'feh', fix it not breaking fen, 'xviewer' can also break fen rarely
- Make the "open with" modal a selectable list with tab/shift+tab controls aswell as arrow keys, would replace inputfield placeholder and reset input text to blank
- Configurable keybindings
- Configurable custom themes by changing `tview.Styles`
- Jump to file/folder created on n/N
- Commands like :mkdir etc.?
- Fix some hidden file toggle bugs?
- Disallow recursive copies or whatever
- (Maybe...) Vim/ranger stuff like `5<space>` selecting 5 files, or `5j` going down 5
- Remove being able to delete while mid and right pane are empty? (Going into an empty folder (mid and right pane are empty), then deleting it will set selected entry on the left pane to 0 instead of matching the GoDown() when deleting in middlePane)
- 'n' is a little too close to 'M', maybe change it?
- Fix `history_test.go` for Windows paths
- Fix green color for all executables (the current bitmask check doesn't work for everything)
- Fix invisibility near root dir (easy to see on Android with Termux)
- Performance: Caching stuff (maybe only re-dirlist for left/right)
- `H` and `L` controls feel weird because the screen scrolls in a specific way instead of just setting the cursor to the bottom of the screen like the behaviour in vim
- Optional xdg trash specification? https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html
